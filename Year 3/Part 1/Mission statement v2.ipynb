    "\n",
    "6. **Forestry Digital Twin With Machine Learning in Landsat 7 Data**  \n",
    "   - **Relevance**: Talks about the use of remote sensing and machine learning for digital twin models of forests. This is relevant for understanding the integration of remote data in forest growth modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Machine Learning Assisted Remote Forestry Health Assessment**  \n",
    "   - **Relevance**: Focuses on machine learning applications in assessing forest health, which may have some overlap with growth prediction and biomass estimation but is not the primary focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Using Machine Learning to Identify Incentives in Forestry Policy**  \n",
    "   - **Relevance**: More focused on policy and economics than on the technical aspects of forest growth or biomass estimation, but it still involves machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Statistical Methods and Applications in Forestry**  \n",
    "   - **Relevance**: This provides foundational statistical methods which are essential in validating the machine learning models but is less focused on advanced machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures**  \n",
    "    - **Relevance**: Similar to the above file, this document is focused on financial disclosures related to nature, which is not relevant for your technical comparison of algorithms."
