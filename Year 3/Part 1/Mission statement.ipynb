    "How it looks in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision:\n",
    "Imagine a statistical tool that, based on data, predicts the likelihood of a pest outbreak affecting a specific region over the next 5 years. We’ll work on integrating that data with financial models, which would show the potential economic loss if the risk isn’t mitigated.\n",

    "### What it is:\n",
    "This project is about applying mathematical optimization techniques to forestry operations, aiming to improve the allocation of resources such as labor, machinery, and harvesting schedules. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency while ensuring that sustainability standards are met.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Potential areas in current forestry practices that could benefit from optimization (e.g., inefficient scheduling of machinery).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision:\n",
    "We create a model that suggests the best schedule for harvesting trees, considering growth rates, weather conditions, and machinery availability. This results in more efficient use of resources, reduced costs, and better forest health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Sweden and Mistra Digital Forest:\n",

    "The impact of various forestry practices on biodiversity and ecosystem health (e.g., logging vs. conservation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision\n",
    "We might create a statistical model that shows how logging a certain percentage of a forest affects species diversity over time. This would guide forest managers on how to maintain biodiversity while still benefiting from timber production.\n",
